## Introduction
A portal for legacy computers and devices by Windows Vista Bar.

The site is designed by [@solderwire (巨硬中冰)](https://github.com/solderwire) using Microsoft FrontPage 2003. Maintained by [@JC_ProPlus](https://github.com/JC-ProPlus) and [@solderwire (巨硬中冰)](https://github.com/solderwire).
